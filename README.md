# reddit-news-on-twitter

This is an application that reads the top 10 hottest posts on reddit/r/news and, if the post has more than a certain amount of upvotes, forwards the post and the article to a twitter account (@RedditHotNews).

This was made with two API wrappers, praw and python-tweeter, to handle the reddit posts and tweeting. I learned how to use APIs on a very basic level, and how to troubleshoot and read documentation effectively.

This project was completed in a single day.
